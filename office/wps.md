# wps

We prefer WPS office.  It has better compatability with Microsoft documents than libreoffice.

Download the Linux Deb package from https://www.wps.com/

Right click the downloaded deb package and select "Install with Linux (Beta)"

# Commands to launch office apps:

> wps<br>
> et<br>
> wpp<br>
> wpspdf
